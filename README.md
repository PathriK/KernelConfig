# KernelConfig
Control each of Your Kernel options with widgets

Some Custom Kernel features for Android devices are toggled by numbers in a small config file. For eg., the 'FastCharge' feature that is available in many kernels is enabled if a number '1' is entered in a specific file in the system memory. If the contents of the file is written as '0' then FastCharge is disabled. Unfortunately the ways in which this can be done are either through commands in terminal or with Apps that costs a lot.
With this app, one can specify the path of the file that needs to be changed, the values that needs to be cycled, along with the values/string that needs to be displayed in the widget for the corresponding toggle values.

Features:
-Custom file paths can be entered
-Custom toggle values can be used

Limitations:
-Only one instance of the widget can be used for now.
-No SDCard Permission is added, so does not work with SD Card files
-Yet to include root permissions to write to files that are in Read Only

As of now, it is pretty basic and lot of features will be added.

As usual all your comments/feedback are welcomed
